Shock at being a homeowner

### RadDIY

##### RadioactiveDIY?

GAI app that gives home improvement help.
Sort of wild.
Buy it all on Amazon.com, I guess? Hrm

Lots of talk about Medical industry, Amazon just bought the 2nd largest healthcare provider company, didn't they?

### Bedrock Bedrock Bedrock Marsha! (everyone at AWS since yesterday)

## EVEN MORE BEDROCK STUFF

### Innovation Center Custom Model Program with Anthropic Claude (on AWS Bedrock)


Good lord that's a mouthful, eh?

AWS ICCMPACOB?

### Sagemaker

ML Lifecycle tools

Data preperation to model deployment

StabilityAI, HuggingFace, others ....

Parallel processing.

Frequent checkpoints, hardware fault healing

Reduces training disruption incidents.

A slew of new features across the Inference Training and MLOps work process.

Build, train and deploy new ML models quickly

## Building a strong data strategy

Databases
BI tools
Gen AI makes this even more critical (!? It does?)

Integrations end to end with good tooling are necessary. Yeah, well no kidding.

Tell me something good.

AWS Database list-off 
- Dynamo 
- RDS 
- Redshift 
- S3 Lakes 
- QuickSight BI

Tools, APIs and databases.

Evolve to use vector capabilities to databases, all of them

Ooh, vector queries for ALL THE THINGS

"Vector Engine for OpenSearch Service"

That sounds pretty badass

Billions of vectors in Aurora with single-digit ms latency from Aurora vector queries.

Json data vector search, is that a thing? Oh my, I guess it is.

Vector Engine for Document and Dynamo

That's honestly pretty badass.

Vector Search queries in preview for MemoryDB for Redis

### Neptune Analytics

Graph data analytics 
80% faster than what? 

Vector vector vector search search search, graph theory is neato

Okay, 2nd pillar of the strong data foundation.

Integrated from across all sikos,                                                                                                                All your log data in one place no ETL pipeline

Also includes materialized views,

Zero ETL integrations. We'll see if that works.

## Booking.com

150 Petabytes of data, what do?

use AWS go faster they did, Yoda I am. Bae, what?

Symbiosis GenAI feedback loopsiedoopsiedoo!

Uh oh my notes are getting silly. I blame pancakes.

### Data Warehouse Administration

GenAI driven scaling and optimization for Amazon Redshift Serverless 

Amazon Q, everywhere, this is their big-ass ML assistant product, Skynet mama tech

![[Pasted image 20231129105529.png]]

I CALLED THIS OUTLOUD, AND THEN HE SAID IT

![[Pasted image 20231129105553.png]]

Lol apparently this is hard

![[Pasted image 20231129105619.png]]

Amazon Q in Redshift, because of course.

![[Pasted image 20231129105642.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231129105820.png]]

Coming soon Data Integration Pipelines with Natural Language.

AWS Glue, Amazon Q, Bedrock Agents, it's all new, it's all ragin, we need some lyrics up on that stage to go with those mad beats.

She has more energy than anyone ever, what a good presenter

Why can't I get the data I want in the place I want it so I can tell a story in pictures, my 
![[Pasted image 20231129110145.png]]

Heterogeneous data in varied sources.

Zero integration ETL services, slay AWS, slay

itches don't know bout my zero ETL integrations 

Aurora, Redshift, Kinesis Streams, Amazon Q Dashboards, flashes go off everywhere.

Making the silliness of our jobs more obvious every day.

She was a crackerjack,

Stream dropping that beat again, I feel so victorious, oh the soundtrack of it all :D

### Dr Kingsley Ndoh

Sub-Sarahan Africa doesn't have enough oncologists
Not shocking

HuronAI?

Amazon bedrock
Awesome cancer research news.

Honor Dr Kingsley because apparently he's a pioneer in cancer detection in Africa, I missed the specific claim, but I'm sure he's great.

CodeWhisperer, I wonder if it is any good compared to CoPilot, what data did they train it on? Github is a pretty good dataset, I can't imagine Amazon's is better, or maybe it's actually scraped from GH, and so it contains most of the copilot stuff? 

I think MS has that market on lock, if I'm honest, but AWS probably has better ethics and more generalized aims than those of MS.

All this ML marketing at Re:Invent right after the OpenAI shake-up seems potentially connected. Everyone is staking their claims on the "AI" market. The money rush around ML is huge, but why this year, why not five years ago? 

Ad for something here...I didn't get moved by the little movie piece.

Good keynote, overall. 

Oh, now we're going to talk about human intellect. Is that even still a thing?

Oh, I can think of myself as a facilitator? That sounds extremely awful, thanks.

Some sort of metaphor about the rainforest? Okay, cool, cool, wat?

![[Pasted image 20231129111423.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231129111436.png]]

Data, Humans, and Generative AI...sigh, I find this to be more than a bit tediously precious. Silly.

Ego massage
![[Pasted image 20231129111543.png]]

Ada Lovelace callback was made, in a feat of groaningly tedious self-congratulatory play-school intellectualism. But okay. Sure.

Why can't we write creative entertaining presentations? T
his sterile presentation style does not provoke a strong emotional response in me.

### The Re-scaling Revolution

The part where we eliminate millions of jobs with AI and pretend we didn't do that, passing the problem on to future generations. 

"The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed" - some guy somewhere at one point, probably, I forget


## PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock playground

### No Code thing for Gen AI

#### Looks like Scratch for ML

Titan Express and Titan Lite models are also integrated in PartyRock now.
